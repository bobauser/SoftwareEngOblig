Oblig 3 - Rapport

I started by creating a git repository and upload all my files from intellij. From there I struggled alot with the pom.xml file, since there was multiple versions of plugins I had to change to adress the correct version. Aswell as adding dependencies to this, there were multiple times where the dependencies logged an error when I tried testing maven on github. These errors included scopes, names and placement in project, it took time but in the end the errors were quite easy, and revolved souly on spelling errors and a missing group-id statement. While in the githubXxx folder and in the XXX file, the version of java and itâ€™s jdk was outdated, also causing an error, but now it works and it tests the leapyear function in java as normal.
